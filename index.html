<h2>What Is CSS?</h2>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages—for example, to alter the font, color, size and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. </p>
</section>

<!-- Section 2 -->
<section class="main-section" id="CSS_Syntax">
<header>CSS Syntax</header>
<p>At its most basic level, CSS consists of two building blocks:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Properties</strong>: Human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features (e.g., font, width, background color) you want to change.</li>
    <li><strong>Values</strong>: Each specified property is given a value, which indicates how you want to change those stylistic features (e.g., what you want to change the font, width, or background color to.)</li>
</ul>
    A property paired with a value is called a CSS declaration. CSS declarations are put within CSS Declaration Blocks. And finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS Rulesets (or CSS Rules).</p>
    <h3>CSS Declarations</h3>
    <p>Setting CSS properties to specific values is the core function of the CSS language. The CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every single element of a page in order to appropriately lay it out and style it. The property and value in each pair is separated by a colon.</p>
    <p>Declarations are grouped in blocks, with each set of declarations being wrapped by an opening curly brace { and a closing one } . The declarations inside a declaration block must be separated by semi-colons (;), otherwise the code won't work (or will at least give unexpected results). </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            h1 {
            color: blue;
            background-color: yellow;
            border: 1px solid black;
          }
        </code>
    </pre>
    <pre>
        <code>    
          p {
            color: red;
          }
          
          p, li {
            text-decoration: underline;
          }
        </code>
    </pre>
    </section>

<!-- Section 3 -->
<section class="main-section" id="CSS_Selectors">
<header>CSS Selectors</header>
<p>In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine grained precision when selecting elements to style.</p>
<h3>Simple Selectors</h3>
<p>Simple selectors directly match one or more elements of a document, based on the type of element, <em>class</em> or <em >id</em>.</p>
<pre>
    <code>
            /* All p elements are red */

            p {
            color: red;
            }
    </code>
</pre>
<pre>
    <code>
            /* All div elements are blue */

            div {
            color: blue;
            }
    </code>
</pre>
<h3>Class Selectors</h3>
<p>The class selector consists of a dot, '.', followed by a class name. A class name is any value, without spaces, placed within an HTML class attribute. It is up to you to choose a name for the class. It is also noteworthy that multiple elements in a document can have the same class value, and a single element can have multiple class names separated by white space.</p>
<pre>
<code>
            /* The element with the class "first" is bolded */

            .first {
            font-weight: bold;
            }
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
    <code>
            /* All the elements with the class "done" are strikethrough */

            .done {
            text-decoration: line-through;
            }
</code>
</pre>
<h3>ID Selectors</h3>
<p>The ID selector consists of a hash/pound symbol (#), followed by the ID name of a given element. Any element can have a unique ID name set with the id attribute. It is up to you to choose an ID name. It's the most efficient way to select a single element.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> An ID name must be unique in the document. Behaviors regarding duplicated IDs are unpredictable. For example, in some browsers, only the first instance is counted, and the rest are ignored. </p>

<pre>
    <code>
            #polite {
            font-family: cursive;
            }
     </code>
</pre> 
<pre>
    <code>      
            #rude {
            font-family: monospace;
            text-transform: uppercase;
            }
    </code>
</pre>
<h3>Pseudo-Classes</h3>
<p>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to the end of a selector, preceded by a colon (:), which is used to specify that you want to style the selected element but only when it is in a certain state. For example, you might want to style a link element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer, or a checkbox when it is disabled or checked, or an element that is the first child of its parent in the DOM tree.</p>
<pre>
    <code>
            /* These styles will style our link in all states */

            a {
            color: blue;
            font-weight: bold;
            }
    </code>
</pre>
<pre>
    <code>
            /* We want visited links to be the same color as non-visited links */

            a:visited {
            color: blue;
            }
        </code>
</pre>
<pre>
    <code>
            /* We highlight the link when it is hovered over (mouse over), activated (mouse down) or focused (keyboard) */

            a:hover,
            a:active,
            a:focus {
            color: darkred;
            text-decoration: none;
            }
    </code>
</pre>

<!-- Section 4 -->
<section class="main-section" id="The_CSS_Box_Model">
<header>The CSS Box Model</header>
<p>The CSS box model is the foundation of layout on the Web — each element is represented as a rectangular box, with the box's content, padding, border, and margin built up around one another like the layers of an onion. As a browser renders a web page layout, it works out what styles are applied to the content of each box, how big the surrounding onion layers are, and where the boxes sit in relation to one another. Before understanding how to create CSS layouts, you need to understand the box model.</p>
<h3>Box Properties</h3>
<p>Every element within a document is structured as a rectangular box inside the document layout, the size and "onion layers" of which can be tweaked using some specific CSS properties. The relevant properties are as follows:</p>
<h4>Width and Height</h4>
<p>The width and height properties set the width and height of the content box, which is the area in which the content of the box is displayed — this content includes both text content set inside the box, and other boxes representing nested child elements.</p>
<h4>Padding</h4>
<p>Padding refers to the inner margin of a CSS box — between the outer edge of the content box and the inner edge of the border. The size of this layer can be set on all four sides at once with the padding shorthand property, or one side at a time with the padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom and padding-left properties.</p>
<h4>Border</h4>
<p>The border of a CSS box sits between the outer edge of the padding and the inner edge of the margin. By default the border has a size of 0 — making it invisible — but you can set the thickness, style and color of the border to make it appear. The border shorthand property allows you to set all of these on all four sides at once, for example border: 1px solid black. This can be broken down into numerous different longhand properties for more specific styling needs:
<ul>
    <li>border-top, border-right, border-bottom, border-left: Set the thickness, style and color of one side of the border.</li>
    <li>border-width, border-style, border-color: Set only the thickness, style, or color individually, but for all four sides of the border.</li>
    <li>You can also set one of the three properties of a single side of the border individually, using border-top-width, border-top-style, border-top-color, etc. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Margin</h4>
<p>The margin surrounds a CSS box, and pushes up against other CSS boxes in the layout. It behaves rather like padding; the shorthand property is margin and the individual properties are margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.</p>

    </section>
<!-- Section 5 -->
<section class="main-section" id="Styling_Text">
<header>Styling Text</header>
<p>The CSS properties used to style text generally fall into two categories:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Font styles: Properties that affect the font that is applied to the text, affecting what font is applied, how big it is, whether it is bold, italic, etc.</li>
    <li>Text layout styles: Properties that affect the spacing and other layout features of the text, allowing manipulation of, for example, the space between lines and letters, and how the text is aligned within the content box.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Color</h3>
<p>The color property sets the color of the foreground content of the selected elements (which is usually the text, but can also include a couple of other things, as an underline or overline placed on text using the text-decoration property).</p>

  <p><em>color</em> can accept any CSS color unit, for example:</p>
  <pre>
      <code>
            p {
                color: red;
            }
      </code>
  </pre>


  <h3>Font Family</h3>
  <p>To set a different font on your text, you use the font-family property — this allows you to specify a font (or list of fonts) for the browser to apply to the selected elements. The browser will only apply a font if it is available on the machine the website is being accessed on; if not, it will just use a browser default font.</p>
  <pre>
      <code>
        p {
            font-family: arial;
        }
      </code>
  </pre>
<p>This would make all paragraphs on a page adopt the Arial font.</p>
