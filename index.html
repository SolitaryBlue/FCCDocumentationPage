<h2>What Is CSS?</h2>
<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pagesâ€”for example, to alter the font, color, size and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. </p>
</section>

<!-- Section 2 -->
<section class="main-section" id="CSS_Syntax">
<header>CSS Syntax</header>
<p>At its most basic level, CSS consists of two building blocks:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Properties</strong>: Human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features (e.g., font, width, background color) you want to change.</li>
    <li><strong>Values</strong>: Each specified property is given a value, which indicates how you want to change those stylistic features (e.g., what you want to change the font, width, or background color to.)</li>
</ul>
    A property paired with a value is called a CSS declaration. CSS declarations are put within CSS Declaration Blocks. And finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS Rulesets (or CSS Rules).</p>
    <h3>CSS Declarations</h3>
    <p>Setting CSS properties to specific values is the core function of the CSS language. The CSS engine calculates which declarations apply to every single element of a page in order to appropriately lay it out and style it. The property and value in each pair is separated by a colon.</p>
    <p>Declarations are grouped in blocks, with each set of declarations being wrapped by an opening curly brace <code>{</code> and a closing one <code>}</code>. The declarations inside a declaration block must be separated by semi-colons (;), otherwise the code won't work (or will at least give unexpected results). </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
            h1 {
            color: blue;
            background-color: yellow;
            border: 1px solid black;
          }
          
          p {
            color: red;
          }
          
          p, li {
            text-decoration: underline;
          }</code>
    </pre>
    </section>

<!-- Section 3 -->
<section class="main-section" id="CSS_Selectors">
<header>CSS Selectors</header>
In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine grained precision when selecting elements to style.
<h3>Simple Selectors</h3>
<p>Simple selectors directly match one or more elements of a document, based on the type of element, <code>class</code>, or <code>id</code>.</p>
<pre>
    <code>
            /* All p elements are red */
            p {
            color: red;
            }

            /* All div elements are blue */
            div {
            color: blue;
            }
    </code>
</pre>
<h3>Class Selectors</h3>
<p>The class selector consists of a dot, '.', followed by a class name. A class name is any value, without spaces, placed within an HTML class attribute. It is up to you to choose a name for the class. It is also noteworthy that multiple elements in a document can have the same class value, and a single element can have multiple class names separated by white space.</p>
<pre>
<code>
            /* The element with the class "first" is bolded */
            .first {
            font-weight: bold;
            }

            /* All the elements with the class "done" are strikethrough */
            .done {
            text-decoration: line-through;
            }
</code>
</pre>
<h3>ID Selectors</h3>
The ID selector consists of a hash/pound symbol (#), followed by the ID name of a given element. Any element can have a unique ID name set with the id attribute. It is up to you to choose an ID name. It's the most efficient way to select a single element.

<strong>Important:</strong> An ID name must be unique in the document. Behaviors regarding duplicated IDs are unpredictable. For example, in some browsers, only the first instance is counted, and the rest are ignored.

<pre>
    <code>
            #polite {
            font-family: cursive;
            }
            
            #rude {
            font-family: monospace;
            text-transform: uppercase;
            }
    </code>

</pre>
<h3>Pseudo-Classes</h3>
<p>A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to the end of a selector, preceded by a colon <code>(:)</code>, which is used to specify that you want to style the selected element but only when it is in a certain state. For example, you might want to style a link element only when it is being hovered over by the mouse pointer, or a checkbox when it is disabled or checked, or an element that is the first child of its parent in the DOM tree.</p>
<pre>
    <code>
            /* These styles will style our link
            in all states */
            a {
            color: blue;
            font-weight: bold;
            }

            /* We want visited links to be the same color
            as non visited links */
            a:visited {
            color: blue;
            }

            /* We highlight the link when it is
            hovered over (mouse over), activated (mouse down)
            or focused (keyboard) */
            a:hover,
            a:active,
            a:focus {
            color: darkred;
            text-decoration: none;
            }
    </code>
</pre>
